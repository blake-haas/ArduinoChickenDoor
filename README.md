# ArduinoChickenDoor
Automatic door for chicken coop (eglu cube) | Can be adapted to work with any coop.
Designed for very low power usage.

This is a project for an automatic chicken door based on light levels.
Door closes at around 19 lux and opens after 50 lux.

Parts list:
1. Arduino Uno / Mini / micro
2. SunFounder 20KG Servo Motor Waterproof High Torque Servo, SF3218MG Metal Gear Digital Servo
3. LM393 Digital Light Intensity Photosensitive Sensor Module for Arduino UNO
4. Power source 9v / 12v. For me it was a 12v tractor battery with a LM2596s Buck Converter tuned to 9v. 
5. Wires and a clear container to mount the light sensing hardware (mayo jar for me).
6 A 3d printer to print my designed parts for the eglu cube or your own diy solution for your coop.
7. Misc m2 bolts / 1 m3 for my designed parts.
